Absolutely, let's expand on the HTML Basics section with more detailed explanations and code examples that you can demonstrate in VS Code. Here's a more comprehensive script:

**Slide Title: Deep Dive into HTML Tags and Elements**

**Speaker Notes:**

"Welcome back! Let's delve deeper into HTML and understand how it forms the backbone of every web page you visit. HTML is not just about displaying content; it's about giving content meaning and structure.

**Slide: Anatomy of HTML Tags**

"HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser displays content. They're like the scaffolding that holds up the content, invisible to the viewer but essential for structure.

**Slide: Opening and Closing Tags Illustrated**

"Each HTML element starts with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag. The content goes between these tags. For example, `<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>` creates a top-level heading on your page.

**Slide: Self-Closing Tags**

"Some elements, like the line break `<br>` and image `<img>` tags, don't wrap content and are self-closing.

**Slide: Nested Tags**

"Tags can be nested inside other tags to create a hierarchy. This is how we build complex page structures.

**Slide: HTML Document Structure with Code**

"Now, let's construct the skeleton of an HTML document. I'll type this out in VS Code, and you can follow along.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the world of HTML.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

"Here, `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares the document type and version of HTML. The `<html>` tag encompasses everything and has an attribute `lang` which specifies the language of your document.

**Slide: The `<head>` Tag Explained with Code**

"Inside the `<head>` tag, we include character encoding `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, which ensures our text renders correctly. The `<meta name="viewport">` tag makes our site mobile-friendly. And the `<title>` tag sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser tab.

**Slide: The `<body>` Tag and Content with Code**

"Moving on to the `<body>` tag, this is where all visible content goes. We've added a `<h1>` tag for our main heading and a `<p>` tag for a welcoming paragraph.

**Slide: Closing the HTML Document**

"And that's the expanded structure of an HTML document! With these basics, you can start creating simple web pages and gradually add more complexity as you learn."
