Certainly! Here's a script for a 2-minute segment on HTML forms:

---

**Introduction to Forms (20 seconds)**
- "Forms are a fundamental part of the web, allowing users to enter data that can be sent to a server for processing."

**The `<form>` Tag (40 seconds)**
- "We use the `<form>` tag to create a form. It can contain text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. Here's a simple form:"
```html
<form action="/submit-form" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
- "The `action` attribute specifies where to send the form data when submitted, and the `method` attribute defines the HTTP method to use."

**Input Fields (30 seconds)**
- "The `<input>` tag is versatile. Here, we've used it to create a text field for a user's name and a submit button."

**Submit Button (20 seconds)**
- "The submit button is crucial. It sends the data to the server. The `value` attribute sets the button's label."

**Closing (10 seconds)**
- "And that's a basic HTML form! With just these elements, you can start collecting user input on your website."
