## 20-Minute Introduction to HTML Course

**Introduction (2 minutes)**

* Hi everyone, and welcome to this 20-minute crash course on HTML! Today, we'll explore the building blocks of web pages and get you started on creating your own!
* Briefly explain what HTML is: Hypertext Markup Language, the foundation of web pages, telling browsers how to display content.

**What You'll Need (1 minute)**

* Text editor (recommend a free option like Visual Studio Code)
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

**Basic Structure (5 minutes)**

* Open your text editor and start with a basic HTML document structure:
  * `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type as HTML
  * `<html>` tag: Encloses the entire HTML document
  * `<head>` tag: Contains information about the document (title, meta tags)
  * `<title>` tag: Defines the title displayed in the browser tab
  * `<body>` tag: Contains the visible content of the web page

**Head & Body (2 minutes)**

* Briefly explain the purpose of the `<head>` tag (meta information) and the `<body>` tag (visible content).
* Show an example with a simple title in the `<head>`.

**Text & Headings (4 minutes)**

* Introduce basic text formatting tags: 
  * `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings of different sizes
  * `<p>`: Paragraphs
  * `<br>`: Line break
* Demonstrate how to use these tags with examples.

**Lists (2 minutes)**

* Explain Ordered (`<ol>`) and Unordered (`<ul>`) lists.
* Show how to create list items using `<li>` tags within the list type.
* Briefly mention nested lists.

**Images (2 minutes)**

* Introduce the `<img>` tag to embed images.
* Explain the `src` attribute to specify the image source (local file path or URL).
* Briefly discuss image optimization for web (optional).

**Links (3 minutes)**

* Explain creating hyperlinks with the `<a>` tag.
*  Demonstrate how to set the `href` attribute to link to another website or an internal page (anchor tag).
* Briefly show how to specify link text with the content between the opening and closing `<a>` tags.

**Conclusion (1 minute)**

* Briefly summarize what you covered: basic structure, text formatting, lists, images, and links.
* Encourage the audience to explore further by practicing code writing and referring to online resources (e.g., W3Schools).

**Bonus (if time allows - 2 minutes)**

* Briefly introduce HTML comments (``) for adding notes not displayed on the page.
* Mention the existence of other HTML elements and attributes for more complex layouts.

**Remember:** 

* Keep the pace engaging and adjust based on the audience's level.
* Use clear explanations with visual examples (code snippets and browser previews).
* Encourage questions throughout the session.
