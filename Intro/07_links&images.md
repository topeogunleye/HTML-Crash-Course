Certainly! Here's a detailed script for a 3-minute segment on creating hyperlinks and inserting images in HTML:

---

**Start (10 seconds)**
- "Let's explore how to enrich our web pages with links and images using HTML."

**Hyperlinks (1 minute)**
- "Hyperlinks, or 'links', connect our page to other pages or resources. We create them with the `<a>` tag. Here's an example:"
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```
- "The `href` attribute specifies the URL we're linking to, and the text between the opening and closing tags is what users click on."

**Inserting Images (1 minute)**
- "Images add visual interest to our pages. We use the `<img>` tag to insert them. Like this:"
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```
- "The `src` attribute tells the browser where to find the image, and the `alt` attribute provides a text description for accessibility and SEO."

**Importance of the `alt` Attribute (45 seconds)**
- "The `alt` attribute is crucial. It describes the image content, which helps search engines understand the image and improves accessibility for users with visual impairments."

**Practice and Tips (15 seconds)**
- "I encourage you to practice adding links and images to your HTML pages. Remember to always include the `alt` attribute for images."

**Closing (10 seconds)**
- "And that's how you add links and images to your web pages! These elements are essential for a dynamic and accessible website."
