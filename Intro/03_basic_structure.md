**Slide Title: Understanding HTML Tags and Elements**

**Speaker Notes:**

"Good morning, everyone! Today, we're going to dive into the basics of HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's the standard language used to create web pages.

**Slide: HTML Tags**

"Let's start with HTML tags. Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They define the structure and content of a web page. Each tag has a specific purpose, like creating a paragraph or a heading.

**Slide: Opening and Closing Tags**

"Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag starts with a less-than symbol followed by the tag name and ends with a greater-than symbol, like this: `<tagname>`. The closing tag is similar but includes a forward slash before the tag name, like this: `</tagname>`.

**Slide: HTML Elements**

"An element is everything from the start tag to the end tag. For example, `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>` Here, `<p>` is the opening tag, `This is a paragraph.` is the content, and `</p>` is the closing tag. Together, they form a paragraph element.

**Slide: Basic HTML Document Structure**

"Now, let's look at the basic structure of an HTML document. Every HTML document starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, which tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

**Slide: The `<html>` Tag**

"Next is the `<html>` tag. This tag wraps all the content on the entire web page and is known as the root element.

**Slide: The `<head>` Tag**

"Inside the `<html>` tag, we have the `<head>` tag. The head contains meta-information about the document, like its title and links to stylesheets.

**Slide: The `<body>` Tag**

"Finally, we have the `<body>` tag. This is where all the visible content goes, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

**Slide: Closing the HTML Document**

"And that's the basic structure of an HTML document! Remember, the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` tag, which contains the `<head>` and `<body>` tags."
